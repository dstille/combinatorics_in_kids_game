# combinatorics_in_kids_game
I have a few games here to teach about permutations and combinations that live in the herding_game_odds folder.

The games start with horse_game.py to teach about permutations through the number of lineups that can be made from the Cousins (my nieces and nephews).

Then mini_lotto.py (which is incomplete) introduces the differences between permutations and combinations by asking how much more of a profit I can turn if I sell lotto tickets with repeated numbers versus unrepeated numbers.

pet_herding.py uses a game about my nephew's Australian Shepherd herding up fellow family pets to teach about combinations, sets and odds.

kid_herding.py takes that game to a new level by using two sets of herding targets: the Adult Cousins and the Kid Cousins.

Games can be run also in Spanish and Portuguese (why not get them to practice there too) by changing 'import strings' to 'import es_strings' or 'import pr_strings' respectively. Those import statements should be towards the top of any game file.
